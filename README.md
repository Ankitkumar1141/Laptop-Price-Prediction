# Laptop Price Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Laptop Price Predictor** is a machine learning-based project that estimates the price of a laptop based on various specifications like processor, RAM, storage, brand, and other key features. This project helps users get an approximate price for a laptop based on given specifications using regression techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts laptop prices based on user input
- Uses machine learning regression models
- Supports various brands and specifications
- Provides insights into feature importance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Streamlit** (for deployment, if applicable)

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains details of laptops with features like:

- Brand
- Processor
- RAM size
- Storage type and capacity
- GPU details
- Display size and resolution
- Operating System
- Price (Target Variable)

## 🔥 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-predictor.git
   cd laptop-price-predictor
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Train the Model**:
   - Open `laptop-price-predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
   - Execute the cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance

## 📊 Model Performance

- Applied multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE, R² score
- Identified key features affecting laptop prices

## 🌍 Deployment (Optional)

- If deployed using **Streamlit**, run:
  ```sh
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
- If using **Flask**, start the server:
  ```sh
  python app.py
  ```
